        <p>
          I'm a Computer Science and Biology student at the University of Calgary,
          passionate about learning how to build secure, scalable systems and full-stack applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like projects that go beyond CRUD — things with real protocols, networking,
          distributed logic, or low-level control. I also strive to create real solutions to real-world problems, through my projects.
